The issue stems from Firebase's Realtime Database security rules not properly handling specific data structures or access patterns.  For example, a rule might inadvertently grant read access to sensitive data due to wildcard characters (*) used too broadly in the ruleset.  Another case might involve insufficiently restrictive rules on updating specific fields, allowing unauthorized modifications. Incorrectly configured authentication methods, or mismatched security rules and client-side code, can lead to similar problems.
