# Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Firebase Realtime Database security rules.  The bug allows unauthorized access to or modification of data due to improperly configured rules.  The `firebase-security-bug.js` file showcases the problematic rule set, while `firebase-security-solution.js` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:** The initial security rules are too permissive, granting unintended access.

**Solution:** The revised rules implement more restrictive access controls, preventing unauthorized actions.

This example highlights the importance of meticulous security rule configuration when using Firebase Realtime Database.
